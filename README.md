# dndSpells

Goal of the project is to create web api that cache spells data from [D&D 5e API](http://www.dnd5eapi.co) and with endpoints for getting data with custom filters and without delay of source api. The source api has great database but works quite slow and can be search directly only with few categories.

Created api should also have ability to store data of logged in user with selected spells etc.

The next step is to create VueJS mobile first application that will use methods of api. It should be fully functional dnd spells helper.
